# Introduction to LangChain

LangChain is a framework designed to build applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It facilitates seamless integration with LLMs, external tools, and APIs, enabling developers to create more advanced and customizable applications.

## Features

- Easy integration with different language models (LLMs)
- Support for document retrieval and processing
- Workflow orchestration for complex tasks
- Simple yet powerful chain-building functionality

## Code Example

Here’s an example of using LangChain with OpenAI’s GPT-3 model:

```javascript
const { OpenAI } = require('langchain/llms');
const { LLMChain } = require('langchain/chains');

const openAI = new OpenAI({ apiKey: 'your-openai-api-key' });
const chain = new LLMChain({ llm: openAI, prompt: 'Translate the following English text to French: {text}' });

async function translateText(text) {
  const result = await chain.call({ text });
  console.log(result.text);  // Output: French translation
}
